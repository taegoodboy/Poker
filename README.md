<h1>Poker Progam</h1>
=====================
<h8><p>Poker is a family of card games involving betting and individual play, 
whereby the winner is determined by the ranks and combinations of their cards, 
some of which remain hidden until the end of the game.
Poker games vary in the number of cards dealt,
the number of shared or "community" cards and the number of cards that remain hidden.
The betting procedures vary among different poker games in such ways as betting
limits and splitting the pot between a high hand and a low hand.</p></h8>
