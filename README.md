<h8><p>
	Poker is a family of card games involving betting and individual play, 
	whereby the winner is determined by the ranks and combinations of their cards, 
	some of which remain hidden until the end of the game.
	Poker games vary in the number of cards dealt,
	the number of shared or "community" cards and the number of cards that remain hidden.
	The betting procedures vary among different poker games in such ways as betting
	limits and splitting the pot between a high hand and a low hand.</p></h8>
<h3>List of poker hands</h3><p>
	In poker, players construct hands of five cards according to predetermined rules,
	which vary according to which variant of poker is being played.
	These hands are compared using a hand ranking system that is standard across all variants of poker,
	the player with the highest-ranking hand winning that particular deal in most variants of poker.
	In some variants, the lowest-ranking hand can win or tie.</p>
